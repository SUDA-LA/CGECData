# NaSGEC-v2

+ In our ACL'24 paper [Towards Better Utilization of Multi-Reference Training Data for Chinese Grammatical Error Correction](https://github.com/ymliucs/Publications/blob/main/MrGEC(ACL'24%20Findings).pdf), we discover that FCGEC-Train and NaSGEC-Exam/NaCGEC suffer from a significant data leakage issue, even when utilizing [FCGEC_train_filtered.json](https://github.com/xlxwalex/FCGEC/blob/main/data/FCGEC_train_filtered.json).
+ We open-source the corresponding processing code and processed data in the [official repository](https://github.com/ymliucs/MrGEC) of this paper.
