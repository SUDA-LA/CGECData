We obtain the corresponding data from the official GitHub repository of [FCGEC](https://github.com/xlxwalex/FCGEC/tree/main/data). Note that for the training set, we use the filtered version, which ensures that there are no input sentences in the training set that are identical to those in the development and test sets. However, there is still a serious [data leakage problem](https://github.com/ymliucs/MrGEC#handle-data-leakage) that needs to be dealt with.
