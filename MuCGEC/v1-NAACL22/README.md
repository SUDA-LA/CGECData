# MuCGEC-v1

For detailed information about the MuCGEC dataset, please refer to this repository: [HillZhang1999/MuCGEC](https://github.com/HillZhang1999/MuCGEC).

## ðŸ“¢ Important Update
We open-source the MuCGEC-Test data in [M2](mucgec.test.m2) format. You can now achieve identical evaluation results to those on the [Tianchi](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/131328/submission) platform using the [ChERRANT](https://github.com/HillZhang1999/MuCGEC/tree/main/scorers/ChERRANT) tool.
